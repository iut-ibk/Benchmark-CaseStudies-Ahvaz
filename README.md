This is an optimized semi-real world benchmark of urban stormwater networks from a flat region in city of Ahvaz/Iran. 

In addition to two (optimized) branched centralized and decentralized networks, redundant flow pathways are cumulatively added to these structures based on three strategies (i.e., from upstream sections towards downstream sections, from downstream sections towards upstream sections and from sensitive locations determined by complex network theory). Further, comparing the nodes that cut during the layout optimization process with the nodes from the base graph (consisting of all possible sewers and nodes, e.g., street network), 181 and 131 nodes are identified for centralized and decentralized networks, respectively to introduce redundant flow paths, 

Thus, this database includes 543 (181 × 3 strategies) networks for centralized layout (forming different number of loops), and 393 (131 × 3 strategies) networks for decentralized layout (forming different number of loops). Overall, 938 urban stormwater networks are created within this database.
